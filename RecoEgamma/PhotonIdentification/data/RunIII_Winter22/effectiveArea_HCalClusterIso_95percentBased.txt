# This file contains the Effective Area (EA) constants for computing
# PU-corrections for the variable HCal cluster isolation (IsoH)
#
# ATTACH RELEVANT DOC FOR THE ABOVE
#
# The corrections are made by fitting degree 2 polynomials and
# hence, each correction has two EA constants.
#
# ATTACH DOCS SHOWING PLOTS AND VALUES
